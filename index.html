			<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> Lucy's Pulse <br> Experimental Video Edit, 1920x1080 <br>For this video work, I had a client request that I enhance the experience of his original song by creating a visual element for it. I decided to take the logo
				that I made for him and and use it to pulse along with the beat of his song. He expressed to me the feeling and mood for the song and that is how I chose the background visuals that I used.
